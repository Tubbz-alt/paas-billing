-- Alternate idea:
--
--     Times are stored in the events table. We don't actually need to
--     copy that data.
--
--     TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS RUNNING ON A DAY, WE ONLY NEED TO KNOW:
--
--     - which things are still running at the start of the next day,
--       doable with a simple boolean
--       provided by `cf_usage_events_still_active_from_previous_days`
--
--     - what changes to things starting and stopping happened on that
--       day
--       provided by `cf_usage_events_on_day`
--
--     These are both direct from `cf_usage_events`, and we combine
--     them in the output of `cf_usage_events_relevant_to_day`.
--
--     Commonplace postgres lets us order the events by time and then
--     get for every event get the next event for that resource.

-- IDEAS FOR PROPERTIES WE CAN TEST:
-- (Where a "span" is generically a period of time, e.g., a row in `cf_usage_periods`.)
--
-- No spans should start from an event which isn't running
-- Spans should always be created between following events
-- Precisely one span should start from each running event
-- Multi-day running events should have one span per day (kinda clashes with above when described simply)
-- One span per day should start from each multi-day running event
-- Span timeranges should not include their upper bound
--
-- Running these functions 700 times for every day we've billed so far will
-- surely(?) be slower than how we currently do things once for all days.
-- However, this approach should scale well. Stopped resources aren't considered
-- at all for future days. We only figure out the sequence of events for today.
-- Question isâ€“where is the crossover point and will we reach it within two years?
